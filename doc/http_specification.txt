This document specify the requirements for the implementation of HTTP/1.0:

1 - Protocol Parameters:
	1.1 - HTTP Version:
		<major> = 1*DIGIT
		<minor> = 1*DIGIT
		HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" <major> "." <minor>
	HTTP/1.0 servers must:

      	o recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 requests;

      	o understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0;

      	o respond appropriately with a message in the same protocol version used by the client.
	
  	 HTTP/1.0 clients must:

      	o recognize the format of the Status-Line for HTTP/1.0 responses;

      	o understand any valid response in the format of HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0.

	--> If the protocol version is not specified, the recipient must assume that the message is in the simple HTTP/0.9 format.

	1.2 - http URL:
       http_URL       = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path ]

       host           = <A legal Internet host domain name
                         or IP address (in dotted-decimal form),
                         as defined by Section 2.1 of RFC 1123>

       port           = *DIGIT

       abs_path       = "/" rel_path
       rel_path       = [ path ] [ ";" params ] [ "?" query ]

       path           = fsegment *( "/" segment )
       fsegment       = 1*pchar
       segment        = *pchar

       params         = param *( ";" param )
       param          = *( pchar | "/" )

       scheme         = 1*( ALPHA | DIGIT | "+" | "-" | "." )
       net_loc        = *( pchar | ";" | "?" )
       query          = *( uchar | reserved )
       fragment       = *( uchar | reserved )

       pchar          = uchar | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+"
       uchar          = unreserved | escape
       unreserved     = ALPHA | DIGIT | safe | extra | national

       escape         = "%" HEX HEX
       reserved       = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+"
       extra          = "!" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")" | ","
       safe           = "$" | "-" | "_" | "."
       unsafe         = CTL | SP | <"> | "#" | "%" | "<" | ">"
       national       = <any OCTET excluding ALPHA, DIGIT,

       --> The canonical form for "http" URLs is obtained by converting any UPALPHA characters in host to their LOALPHA equivalent 
           (hostnames are case-insensitive), eliding the [ ":" port ] if the port is 80, and replacing an empty abs_path with "/".

	1.3 - Date/time formats:

       Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT    ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
       Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
       Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994         ; ANSI C's asctime() format

	--> HTTP/1.0 clients and servers that parse the date value should accept all three formats, though they must never generate the third (asctime) format.

2 - Request:
       Full-Request   = Request-Line             ; Section 5.1
                        *( General-Header        ; Section 4.3
                         | Request-Header        ; Section 5.2
                         | Entity-Header )       ; Section 7.1
                        CRLF
                        [ Entity-Body ]          ; Section 7.2
       Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
       Method         = "GET"                    ; Section 8.1
                      | "HEAD"                   ; Section 8.2
                      | "POST"                   ; Section 8.3
       Request-URI    = absoluteURI | abs_path
       Request-Header = Authorization            ; Section 10.2
                      | From                     ; Section 10.8
                      | If-Modified-Since        ; Section 10.9
                      | Referer                  ; Section 10.13
                      | User-Agent               ; Section 10.15
